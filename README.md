# LeetCode Solutions in C++

Welcome to my repository of LeetCode solutions in C++! In this repository, you'll find a collection of folders, each containing a C++ file with a LeetCode solution and a README file with the corresponding question and examples.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **/Problem1**: This folder contains the solution to [LeetCode Problem #1](link-to-the-problem) in C++.
  - `solution.cpp`: C++ code implementing the solution.
  - `README.md`: Detailed explanation of the problem, approach, and examples.

- **/Problem2**: This folder contains the solution to [LeetCode Problem #2](link-to-the-problem) in C++.
  - `solution.cpp`: C++ code implementing the solution.
  - `README.md`: Detailed explanation of the problem, approach, and examples.

- **/Problem3**: This folder contains the solution to [LeetCode Problem #3](link-to-the-problem) in C++.
  - `solution.cpp`: C++ code implementing the solution.
  - `README.md`: Detailed explanation of the problem, approach, and examples.

(Repeat this structure for each problem you have solved)
